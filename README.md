# Machine-Learning-based-Infants-Sucking-Patterns-Classification
Breastfeeding is a highly intricate process that requires the harmonious coordination of swallowing, breathing, and sucking. The adequacy of nutrients delivered to an infant during breastfeeding hinges on the child's sucking proficiency. Real-time assessment of whether a baby is receiving the necessary amount of milk is challenging, and often, signs of unhealthy sucking are identified after the baby has already experienced a nutrient deficiency. Traditional assessments conducted by clinicians rely on the expertise and subjective judgment of the healthcare professionals, making it prone to variability. In this research, we present a novel approach to classifying sucking patterns by leveraging data collected from infants during breastfeeding sessions. We utilized artificial nipple-based sensors to capture tongue forces exerted by infants, generating valuable clinical data.
    To analyze the collected time-series data, we applied machine learning algorithms to extract pertinent features and identify distinctive sucking patterns. The best-performing model demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 90\%, an 80\% recall score, a perfect 100\% precision score, a 0.90 f1-score, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90.The proposed classification system has the potential to serve as a reliable decision-support tool for clinicians, offering valuable insights into infants' breastfeeding behaviors. By integrating machine learning into clinical practice, we aim to enhance the early identification of unhealthy sucking patterns, allowing for timely interventions and proactive healthcare management.
